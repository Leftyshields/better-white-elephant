# GAME LOGIC ENFORCEMENT
When modifying `gameReducer.js`, `useGameEngine.js`, or any game logic:
1. You MUST consult `GAME_RULES.md` (or wherever you saved it) as the absolute Source of Truth.
2. If a proposed code change contradicts a rule in that file (especially Steal Chains, Swap Logic, or End Game conditions), you must prioritize the Rule file over the current code.
3. Validate all edge cases against the "Validation Rules" section of that document.

# CRITICAL LOGIC INVARIANTS
- Steal Count NEVER resets on a swap.
- The Game NEVER ends if wrapped gifts remain.
- Player 1 gets a special final turn in Standard Mode.
